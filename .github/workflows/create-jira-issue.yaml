      # Unfortunately, there is an automation in our JIRA that modifies the labels, so even if we include it
      # during the creation of the issue, they are removed. So, unfortunately we need to add them later
      # by letting the automation taking place (sleeping, sorry for the dirty hack) and then updating the issue.
