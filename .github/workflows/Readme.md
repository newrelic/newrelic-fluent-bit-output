To [enhance security](https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/why-you-should-pin-actions-by-commit-hash), it's recommended to pin GitHub actions in workflows to a particular commit SHA rather than a tag. A Node-based tool called [pin-github-action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action) can automate this process. You can run this tool locally whenever you add or change actions in a workflow file. The README for the tool provides detailed instructions on installation and execution.
